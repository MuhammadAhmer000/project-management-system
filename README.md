# Mall Management System (Software Engineering Project)

## Overview
This repository contains a semester‑long software engineering project completed as part of a university course. It demonstrates the full **software development lifecycle** (Waterfall model) for a Mall Management System, from requirements gathering to prototype implementation and testing.

The focus of the assignment was to follow SE principles and documentation standards, rather than building a full commercial product.

---

## 📌 Project Scope
This project covers:
- Requirements (SRS)
- Use case modeling
- Domain modeling
- Sequence diagrams
- Product backlog
- Testing of two prototype implementations

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- phase-01-requirements/ → SRS documentation
- phase-02-use-cases/ → Use case diagrams/specs
- phase-03-domain-model/ → Domain model diagrams
- phase-04-sequence-diagrams/ → Dynamic sequence diagrams
- phase-05-product-backlog/ → Backlog and feature list
- phase-06-testing-system-1/ → Test plans/results for Android prototype
- phase-07-testing-system-2/ → Test plans/results for Java prototype
- system-1-prototype/ → Android Studio project
- system-2-prototype/ java‑eclipse/ → Java Eclipse project
---

## 🛠 Prototypes

### 📱 Android Prototype
A basic Android Studio implementation covering the core use case.

### ☕ Java Prototype
A desktop/Java Eclipse prototype exploring the same functionality.

Both serve as **functional prototypes** rather than complete applications.

## 📌 What You’ll Find Inside
Each phase folder contains its respective reports, diagrams, and documentation created during the project.

---

## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
This project demonstrates:
- Requirements analysis and documentation
- UML modelling (use cases, domain, sequence)
- Backlog creation and planning
- Prototype implementation in two platforms
- System testing and evaluation
